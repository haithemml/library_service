1. The most widely useful application of NLP is classification, that is, the automatic classification of a document into a specific category. This can be used, for example, to:

Sentiment analysis (e.g. are people expressing positive or negative opinions about your product)
Author identification (which author is most likely to have written a given document)
Legal discovery (which documents are relevant to a trial)
Organizing documents by subject
Prioritization of incoming emails.
